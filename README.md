## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
As an integral member of the content curation team for an educational platform catering to undergraduate students, a critical aspect of your role involves providing concise and easily digestible summaries of complex research papers. To streamline this process and enhance efficiency, you are tasked with leveraging the capabilities of various AI-powered text summarization tools. Specifically, you need to summarize a 500-word technical article titled "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using a range of established prompting techniques across four distinct AI platforms: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot. The ultimate aim is to discern which specific combination of prompting technique and AI platform delivers the most superior summary, judged against predefined criteria encompassing accuracy, coherence, simplicity, speed of generation, and the overall user experience associated with the interaction. This evaluation will inform the team's strategy for integrating AI-driven summarization into the platform's content creation workflow.
## Algorithm

The evaluation process will follow a structured algorithm to ensure a systematic and comparative analysis of the different prompting techniques across the chosen AI platforms.

**Step 1:** Selection of the Source Text:

A 500-word technical article titled "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" will be selected as the consistent input for all summarization tasks. This article will cover fundamental concepts such as blocks, chains, cryptography, decentralization, and consensus mechanisms, ensuring sufficient technical depth for evaluation. (Note: For the purpose of this exercise, a representative article on this topic will need to be sourced or created.)

**Step 2:** Defining Prompting Techniques:

Four distinct prompting techniques will be employed for each AI platform:

**Zero-Shot Prompting:** Providing a direct instruction without any prior examples.

**Example Prompt:** "Summarize the following article on blockchain technology for undergraduate students."
  
Few-Shot Prompting: Providing a few examples of the desired summary style and length along with the target article.
Example Prompt:
Article 1: [Short technical excerpt]

Summary 1: [Concise and simple summary]

Article 2: [Another short technical excerpt]

Summary 2: [Another concise and simple summary]

Summarize the following article on blockchain technology for undergraduate students: [The 500-word article]

  
**Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Guiding the AI to break down the summarization process into intermediate steps.

**Example Prompt:** "First, identify the main concepts discussed in the following article on blockchain technology. Then, briefly explain each concept in simple terms. Finally, synthesize these explanations into a concise summary suitable for undergraduate students. The article is: [The 500-word article]"

**Role-Based Prompting:** Instructing the AI to adopt a specific persona while performing the summarization task.
Example Prompt: "You are an experienced educator skilled at explaining complex technical topics to undergraduate students. Summarize the following article on blockchain technology in a clear, concise, and engaging manner suitable for this audience. The article is: [The 500-word article]"

Each of the four prompting techniques will be applied to the "Basics of Blockchain Technology" article on each of the four selected AI platforms:

ChatGPT (e.g., using the web interface or API)  

Gemini (e.g., using the web interface or API)

Claude (e.g., using the web interface or API) 

Copilot (e.g., integrated within a browser or application)

For each combination of prompting technique and AI platform, the time taken to generate the summary will be recorded to assess the "Speed" criterion. The user experience during the interaction (e.g., ease of use, clarity of instructions, responsiveness) will also be noted.

**Step 4:** Evaluation of Summaries:

The generated summaries will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

**Accuracy:** The extent to which the summary correctly reflects the key information and concepts presented in the original article, without introducing errors or misinterpretations. This will involve a detailed comparison between the summary and the source text.

**Coherence:** The logical flow and organization of the summary. It should be easy to understand and follow, with clear connections between different ideas.

**Simplicity:** The use of clear and concise language, avoiding overly technical jargon or complex sentence structures. The summary should be readily understandable by undergraduate students with potentially limited prior knowledge of blockchain technology.

**Speed:** The time taken by the AI platform to generate the summary after receiving the prompt. This will be a quantitative measure.
User Experience: A qualitative assessment of the ease of interacting with each platform using different prompting techniques. This includes the intuitiveness of the interface, the clarity of the AI's response beyond the summary itself, and any challenges encountered during the prompting process.
**Step 5:** Comparative Analysis:

The evaluation results for each combination of prompting technique and AI platform will be compiled and compared. This will involve:
Creating a table or matrix to present the evaluation scores for each criterion across all combinations.
Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each prompting technique on each platform.
Determining which combination(s) consistently perform well across all or most evaluation criteria.
Analyzing any significant differences in performance between the platforms for a given prompting technique, and vice versa.
**Step 6:** Documentation of Results and Observations:

A detailed report will be generated, documenting the entire evaluation process, including:
